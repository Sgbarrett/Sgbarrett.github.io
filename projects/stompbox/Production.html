            <p>Kill The Noise, a world famous producer who once was known by the alias EWUN during the drum and bass era back in the early 2000's. Around the time period that Skrillex exploded in the bass music, a lot of drum and bass producers dropped everything that they were during to pursue the new thriving genre of Dubstep.
